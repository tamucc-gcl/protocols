Inventory of protocols used by the GCL

---

## Organization

* The readme will provide an organized set of links and instructions for maintaining this repo.
* Each protocol will be detailed in a markdown document in the [protocols](./protocols) dir
* Files associated with each protocol will be stored in the [accessory_files](accessory_files) dir and must be linked in the protocol that uses them
* Scripts associated with the protocols will be stored in the [scripts](scripts) dir
* Each new protocol should be created from the [protocol template](protocols/protocol_template.md) markdown doc 
* If this organization scheme doesn't work for a particular protocol, bring this to the attention of @cbird808 to solve
