## Best Practices
- **Clarity and Detail**: Write instructions clearly and unambiguously.  
  Include specific quantities (with units), durations, and conditions so that another researcher can reproduce the experiment.  
  Define abbreviations and acronyms on first use.  
- **Consistency**: Use a consistent format and terminology throughout the protocol.  
  For example, keep the style of headings and lists uniform, and use the same units and symbols for measurements.  
  Write steps in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add 5 µL of buffer").  
- **Safety**: Highlight any critical safety precautions or hazards.  
  Note any dangerous reagents (with proper hazard labels or references to MSDS), required personal protective equipment (PPE), and waste disposal procedures to follow.  
  Ensure the protocol complies with relevant safety regulations or guidelines.  
- **Version Control**: Update the protocol and version number when changes are made.  
  Document any changes or minor variations, as even small adjustments can significantly alter outcomes&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
  Ensure the latest version is easily accessible to the team to avoid confusion.  
- **Validation**: If possible, have someone else follow the protocol to verify it is easy to understand and yields the expected results.  
  Incorporate feedback to improve clarity or fix any issues.  
- **Flexibility**: Use this template as a guide, and adapt it as needed for your specific protocol.  
  Add sub-sections or re-order content as necessary.  
  Ensure all crucial information (purpose, materials, methods, notes, etc.) is included.  

# Version Control Guidelines

These guidelines describe best practices for managing protocol versions using Git and ensure clarity, traceability, and reproducibility in your projects.

---

## 1. Embed Version Metadata

Include the following metadata in each protocol file:
- **Author**: The person who created or last updated the protocol.
- **Date Created**: The date the protocol was initially created.
- **Last Updated**: The date of the most recent update.
- **Version**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, etc.).
- **Tags**: Keywords for categorization (e.g., extraction, cleanup, PCR).

---

## 2. Use Commit History Effectively

- **Commit Often**: Make frequent, incremental commits to capture small changes.
- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Write clear, concise messages that explain *what* changed and *why*.
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should address a single, logical change for easier review and reversion if needed.

---

## 3. Branching and Pull Requests

- **Feature Branches**: Develop new features or updates on separate branches.
- **Pull Requests for Merging**: Use pull requests to review and merge changes into the main branch.
- **Maintain a Stable Main Branch**: Only merge changes that have been thoroughly tested to ensure stability.

---

## 4. Tagging and Releases

- **Tag Releases**: Use Git tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`) to mark significant protocol versions.
- **Release Notes**: Document major changes, bug fixes, or enhancements in release notes or a changelog.

---

## 5. Maintain a Changelog

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Keep a separate file or include a section in your protocols that logs:
  - Date of change
  - Version number
  - Author of the change
  - Brief description of the change
- **Regular Updates**: Update the changelog with every significant change to track the evolution of your protocols.

---

## 6. Continuous Integration and Testing

- **Automated Builds**: Use CI tools to automatically build and test changes before merging.
- **Pre-Merge Testing**: Ensure that all changes pass tests on their respective branches to minimize conflicts and maintain code integrity.

---

## 7. Access Control and Collaboration

- **Limit Access**: Grant repository access only to necessary team members.
- **Peer Reviews**: Encourage code reviews and discussions via pull requests to improve quality and share knowledge.

---

## Conclusion

By following these version control guidelines, your team will maintain a clear, organized, and reliable history of protocol changes. This fosters collaboration, simplifies troubleshooting, and ensures that protocols are reproducible and easy to manage over time.
